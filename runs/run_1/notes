Run #1: 11-11-2019

Two generators:
  - 1-Axis tracking pv system, east to west
  - Fixed-tilt pv system, latitude tilt facing equator

System Size: 5MW
DC/AC Ratio: 1.1
Inverter Efficiency: .96
Losses: 14.0757

Outputs:
  - Input variables
  - AC Generation
  - Capacity Factor
  - Plane of Array Irradiance (POA)
 


# ----------------------------------------------------- #
This is just a performance run, no financial outputs
needed. Most of these configurations are straightforward
but specifying the generator types requries some digging.
I couldn't find a way to directly intuit how to configure
tilting, but the SAM interface can be used to generate
config files for anything!

However, the detailed PV system option appears to require
a specific generation model while the simpler PVWatts
option doesn't allow for fixed latitude tilt. Also, when
specifying tracking, it only gives a singular tilt value
option...let's see what these look like anyway....

I don't see the tilting adjustments in these configs.
But there are some other useful elements:

So, when they say they want inputs as outputs, that means
they want the solar data for their points? These inputs
would include the GHI, DHI, and DNI? It looks like we
have a clearsky data set for each of these, how do they
do that?
