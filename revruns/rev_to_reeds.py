    # Prepare data template that identifies the critical reV outputs used in ReEDS, existing units and ideal units. (Matt)

        # Document in hourlize/ReEDS repos (Matt)

    # Based on the data template, generate appropriate reV documentation, 
     #  clarify units, and maybe prune the unused reV outputs (we'll get a list of the needed outputs from matt above)
